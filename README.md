# FIIT Information Security

A personal collection of coursework, labs, exercises, notes, and practical projects created for the FIIT (Faculty of Informatics and Information Technologies) Information Security course. This repository documents concepts, demonstrates hands-on skills, and provides reusable examples and scripts for learning and teaching information security topics.

> IMPORTANT: If you discover any sensitive data (passwords, private keys, personal information) in this repository, contact the repository owner immediately and do not reuse or distribute that data.

## Repository structure (typical)
- labs/             - Practical lab exercises with write-ups and scripts
- reports/          - Written reports, analyses and post-mortems
- tools/            - Small helper tools and scripts (Python, Bash, etc.)
- notes/            - Summarized lecture notes and cheatsheets
- challenges/       - Capture-The-Flag style challenges and solutions
- README.md         - This file

(Directories may be added as the repository grows — not every directory may be present yet.)

## Project goals
- Provide a structured, practical companion to FIIT information security coursework.
- Demonstrate hands-on skills, reproducible examples, and well-documented steps.
- Serve as a portfolio of exercises and real-world problem solving.

## Skills demonstrated
This repository is designed to showcase a broad set of information security skills and practical techniques. Representative topics include:

- Foundations
  - Security concepts, threat modeling, and secure design principles
  - Risk assessment and responsible disclosure practices

- Cryptography
  - Symmetric and asymmetric cryptography, hashing, and MACs
  - TLS/SSL basics, certificate handling, and common implementation pitfalls

- Network Security
  - Packet analysis (Wireshark), TCP/IP fundamentals, and protocol analysis
  - Common network attacks (ARP spoofing, MITM) and basic defenses (firewalls, IDS)

- Web Application Security
  - OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities: XSS, SQLi, CSRF, Broken Authentication, etc.
  - Manual testing techniques, Burp Suite usage, and secure coding recommendations

- System and Host Security
  - Linux hardening, configuration auditing, and privilege escalation analysis
  - Log analysis and basic incident investigation

- Offensive Security / Pentesting
  - Reconnaissance, enumeration, exploitation basics, and Metasploit examples
  - Post-exploitation techniques, persistence, and cleanup considerations

- Digital Forensics & Incident Response
  - Evidence collection, disk and memory analysis basics, and chain of custody concepts

- Reverse Engineering & Malware Analysis
  - Static/dynamic analysis workflows and tooling (Ghidra, radare2, debuggers)

- Automation & Scripting
  - Reproducible automation with Python, Bash, or PowerShell
  - Small utilities and toolchains to speed up lab work and reporting

## How to use this repository
1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/danielauu/FIIT-information-security.git

2. Browse directories for labs, reports, and tools. Each lab or challenge should include a README or write-up with setup and execution instructions.

3. Use supplied scripts and binaries only in a safe, isolated environment (virtual machines, containers, or a dedicated lab network). Do not run unknown binaries on your main machine.

4. Check each lab's README for required tools, dependencies, and recommended VM images.

## Safety & ethics
- This repository is for educational purposes. Do not use the techniques or tools here to access, damage, or disrupt systems for which you do not have explicit permission.
- Always follow local laws, institutional policies, and responsible disclosure practices.
